## Factory

With the factory pattern we can use factory functions in order to create new objects. A function is a factory function when it returns a new object without the use of the new keyword!

```javascript
const createUser = ({ firstName, lastName, email }) => ({
  firstName,
  lastName,
  email,
  fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
});
```

The factory pattern can be useful if we're creating relatively complex and configurable objects. It could happen that the values of the keys and values are dependent on a certain environment or configuration. With the factory pattern, we can easily create new objects that contain the custom keys and values!

```javascript
const createObjectFromArray = ([key, value]) => ({
  [key]: value,
});

createObjectFromArray(["name", "John"]); // { name: "John" }
```

### Pros

The factory pattern is useful when we have to create multiple smaller objects that share the same properties. A factory function can easily return a custom object depending on the current environment, or user-specific configuration.

### Cons

In JavaScript, the factory pattern isn't much more than a function that returns an object without using the new keyword. ES6 arrow functions allow us to create small factory functions that implicitly return
an object each time.

However, in many cases it may be more memory efficient to create new instances instead of new objects each time.
